## Media Queries and Responsive Design

**Media Queries** tell the browser how to style an element at particular viewport dimensions
**Viewport Meta Tag** tells the browser what width the viewport should be
**Responsive Images** Only load smaller images for mobile devices

In practice when designing a project approach a mobile first approach. plan our site for a small mobile device first and scale it to larger screen. Prioritize around important content
