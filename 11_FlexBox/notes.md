    - Grid layouts
    - Bar charts
    - Equal height columns  

    Mordernizer is a javascript library which detects which browser you are currently viewing on and can tell to serve different layout if flexbox is not supported

- **flex-grow**  is used to expand elements into available space and the rate at which it expands into that available space is governed by the number given. It is all relative to the other container next to it
- **flex-shrink** is the opposite of flex-grow. It determines the rate at which it shrinks as the browser gets smaller. The bigger the shrink rate the more it shrinks
- **flex-wrap** prevents elements from going off page when a minimum width is specified 
- **flex-basis** 

    Justify content is always applied to main axis
